# Case Studies

Here we list links for case studies organized by category and collected by [Markkula Center for Applied Ethics](https://www.scu.edu/ethics/) at Santa Clara University. Since such good and applicable material is already published online, we would like to point you to it and not, as software engineers would say, "reinvent the wheel". 

*Note: Some of the entries within a category might also appear in another category because they are applicable in both.*
